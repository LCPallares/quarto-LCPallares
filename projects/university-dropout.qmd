# University Dropout Analysis

## Introduction

This project examines the factors that contribute to student attrition in Business Administration programs. By analyzing patterns in student data, we can identify at-risk students and develop interventions to improve retention rates.

## Data Collection

The dataset includes:
- Academic performance metrics
- Attendance records
- Socioeconomic indicators
- Survey results on student satisfaction
- Course enrollment history

## Methodology

I used the following analytical techniques:
- Logistic regression to predict dropout probability
- Cluster analysis to identify student archetypes
- Time series analysis to detect critical periods
- Correlation analysis to identify key factors

## Key Findings

1. First-year performance is highly predictive of dropout risk
2. Students with part-time jobs over 20 hours/week show 45% higher attrition
3. Attendance drops significantly 3-4 weeks before formal withdrawal
4. Peer study groups reduce dropout rates by 30%

## Visualizations

```{python}
#| fig-cap: "Dropout rates by semester and program"
#| echo: false

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Sample visualization code (replace with actual visualizations in your project)
semesters = ['1st', '2nd', '3rd', '4th', '5th', '6th']
dropout_rates = [15, 12, 8, 6, 5, 3]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(semesters, dropout_rates, color='skyblue')
plt.title('Dropout Rates by Semester')
plt.xlabel('Semester')
plt.ylabel('Dropout Rate (%)')
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.show()
```

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend:
- Implementing an early warning system based on first-month performance
- Creating flexible scheduling options for working students
- Expanding peer mentoring programs
- Enhancing academic support during critical dropout periods

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that dropout patterns are predictable and interventions can be targeted to specific risk factors and time periods for maximum effect.
